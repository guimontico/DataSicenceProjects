## Overview
In this repository, you will find the source code to various projects I have been working on or still work-in-progress. The majority of the projects are accompanied by a Medium blog post at medium.com/@guilhermebmontico. 

My motivations are learning this Data Science area with the intersection of data cleaning techniques, data visualization, and machine learning models. All the codes are written entirely in Python
