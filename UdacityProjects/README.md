## Files & Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Stack Overflow Survey is the most important survey related to development area, so we can find insights as growing technologies, salary diferences and more insights based on questions. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are two files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name

The survey was fielded from January 23 to February 14, 2019. 

Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.

As an incentive, respondents who finished the survey could opt in to a "Census" badge if they completed the survey.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

the study of this case is in the [Medium blogpost](https://medium.com/@guilhermebmontico/what-makes-you-earn-more-in-your-developer-career-e4dd3cd53ce7)

In this study we find that high salary does not imply job satisfaction.    
People with a high degree of study as a Doctorate have the highest average salary.    
It doesn't have great precision in predicting what it takes to join any major company in the world    

Sometimes we need to understand if we are asking the right questions to get the answers we need, even if an answer is not conclusive directly in your question, it can indicate some information relevant to the career of the developers.
