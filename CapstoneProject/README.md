# Data Science Nanodegree Project 7: Building a Binary Classifier with Spark

Author: Guilherme Bruno Montico

Data: 2020-07-11

## Description

In this Project I will predict user churn of "sparkify", a music streaming serivce.

Blog post for this project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@guilhermebmontico/using-spark-to-analysis-music-streaming-data-e4ecb2d00f75?sk=631ccd9568a6683ba53c3a9ab96f61ea).

## Resulty Summary

Logistic Regression had a basic f1 score of approximately 68%. The modelâ€™s accuracy remains around 74%.    
This result was obtained with an average part of the total available data, it is expected that with the complete data the results can be better    

## Repo Layout

The repo layout in this instance is relatively simple. The work done can be found in the jupyter notebook, Sparkify_project.ipynb. The json file which contains the data was a little too big to commit and so I have ommitted it.
